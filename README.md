# :book: Scratch Client 4 Contributing Guide

Hello! Thanks for wanting to contribute to SC4! This guide is here to explain :

- What SC4 _is_ and _isn't_ about
- Best practices and general rules
- How to keep the discussion organized

## :x: What Scratch Client 4 is and isn't

Often, the nature of Scratch Client 4 projects are misunderstood.

:x: Scratch Client 4 is **not** an alternative community, website, and/or project sharing platform for Scratch.  
:x: Scratch Client 4 is **not** about improving, or reinventing the Scratch editor (what you make projects with).  
:white_check_mark: Scratch Client 4 is about making apps that allow accessing **the existing Scratch _Community_**, managed by the MIT.

## :art: Best practices and general rules

- **Development environement** : You shouldn't edit things directly on GitHub. In order to make changes, please set up a local developement environement.
This varies per project, but most of the time, you'll need to install [git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If you aren't comfortable with using the command line, we recommend you use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). You _may_ do edits directly on GitHub for really minor changes, that don't need testing, like a typo.
- **Commit messages** : Please make commit messages that accurately represent the work done. If you've made multiple changes, sum them up in the first line, and lisdt them in the extended description. Also, this isn't obligated, but always appreciated, that you use [Gitmojis](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me) in your commit messages.
- **master branch** : The `master` branch in repositories should be the latest working development code. We are progressively adding protection for the branch on repositories, but whether it works and is enabled or not, please don't do things on it unless you're an admin, please make a new branch and make a pull request when you're ready to submit changes.
- **Language** : Please stay polite and civil. This is a community-driven project, and everyone should feel welcome and comfortable.

I think that's it!  Hexsphere, Ekmand, if you guys have anything to add, add it!
