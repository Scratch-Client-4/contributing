# README
The list of policies for contributing for the SC4 project

Hello!  Micah (-Archon-) here.  These are just some common-sense rules that need to be followed if you're planning to work on Scratch Client 4.  

- **Commit messages**- make sure commit messages are descriptive so the entire team knows what was changed.
- **Pull requests**- don't just make commits if you're not @micahlt, @hexsphere, or @ekmand.  Please open a pull request so that we can review the code first.  
- **Language**- Yeah, yeah, I know this isn't Scratch, but let's not use foul language.  Be civil.  :D
- **Issues**- Please only file issues that are relevant to the repository you're filing them in.  

I think that's it!  Hexsphere, Ekmand, if you guys have anything to add, add it!
